# MDN Sequencing Animations Challenge

This repository contains the solution to the MDN Sequencing Animations Challenge.

## Overview

The MDN Sequencing Animations Challenge demonstrates how to use JavaScript promises to sequence animations using the Web Animations API. The goal is to apply an animation to three images in sequence, so when the first has finished, the second starts, and when the second has finished, the third starts.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:
- `alice.svg`: SVG image used in the animation.
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file where the animations are defined and sequenced.
- `style.css`: CSS file containing the styles for the page.

## Technologies

The project is built using the following technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Web Animations API
